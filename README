Filesync helps you sync files between two hosts. It does this be keeping a list of files you care about along with an md5sum for each file. Filesync will only send files whose md5sum's differ from what it already knows about.

 $ filesync -s # start a new filesync repository, it will ask you some questions
 $ filesync -a somefile # add a file
 $ filesync -ll # view files that will be synced
 $ filesync -c # sync the file

Setup:

 $ gem install net-sftp
 $ sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev # use whatever -dev version for your ruby
 $ gem install ruby-termios
